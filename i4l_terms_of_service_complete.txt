Terms of Service

Effective Date: March 1, 2025

Welcome to idols4life.com, a fan-focused video platform featuring daily music videos from the I4L Creative Studio’s virtual idol roster — including Pixie and AR, Nova Syndicate, and Imperial Princess.

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a legal agreement between you (“you” or “user”) and I4L Creative Studio (“we,” “us,” or “our”), the creators and operators of the website located at https://idols4life.com (the “Site”). By accessing or using the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

I4L Creative Studio is a creative partnership with co-founders based in the United States and Taiwan. These Terms apply to all users and visitors of the Site, including those who sign up for a membership or engage with our content and services.

If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please do not use the Site.

## 2. User Eligibility

To use idols4life.com, you must be at least 13 years old. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use the Site with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian.

By using this Site, you represent and warrant that:
- You are at least 13 years of age;
- You have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement;
- You are not prohibited from using the Site under any applicable laws.

The Site is intended for fans and viewers from around the world, but access may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Site complies with all laws and regulations applicable to you.

## 3. Memberships and the Founder's Circle

At this time, idols4life.com does not require users to create personal accounts to access or view content on the Site.

However, we offer a paid membership program called the Founder's Circle, designed to support and shape the future of I4L Creative Studio and its virtual idol roster.

By joining the Founder's Circle, members:
- Gain early access to content and platform updates;
- Have the opportunity to share ideas and feedback that may influence future content, community features, or virtual idol development;
- Become part of a limited group of 70 founding supporters who are helping build the next generation of the virtual idol industry.

Participation in the Founder's Circle is voluntary and subject to availability. All purchases are processed through a third-party payment provider, and membership is non-transferable. Additional terms specific to the Founder's Circle may be provided at checkout.

We reserve the right to change, pause, or discontinue the Founder's Circle at any time, with reasonable notice to existing members where possible.

## 4. Acceptable Use

We’re building a respectful, creative, and inclusive community around virtual idols. To help maintain that environment, you agree to use idols4life.com only in ways that are lawful and consistent with the spirit of the platform.
